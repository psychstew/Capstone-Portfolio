#Codebook for Results.csv

The data in Results.csv represent data collected from the responses of participants to the 
[Online Decision Making] survey (https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/GXH5KGK)
These data are suitable for data analysis.

It should be noted that the data contained two participants who did not make a final response. So, out of 122 participants 2 of these were not included in the analysis for this reason.

        * Control group with no manipulated percentages displayed next to the possible responses. 
    2. February, April, June, August, October, December
        * Feedback group that included the manipulated percentages, this was done in the attempt to create a group pressure to conform to an incorrect response.
