##Introduction

This repository contains documents describing the experiment, analysis of data, and all the materials used for particpants to complete the survey. 


The data, analysis, bar graph, and presentation all represent a reproducible real
world example. The data come from my survey,
[Online Decision Making](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/GXH5KGK). They
were processed and analyzed in RStudio. Results of the analysis were written up in a poster that was presented for my Capstone Project at Eastern Oregon University.
